Documentary filmmaking requires more than just a passion for the subject,<br>
whether it be one’s personal story or that of someone else,<br>
a historical event or a startling discovery, a political movement or a heinous crime.<br>
Making a documentary and getting it in front of an audience requires<br>
determination, careful planning, money, and a strong production team

 <span class="span2">by Raj Patel</span><br><br>
 If you were a big fan of the documentary, Food Inc, you'll find even more disturbing truths behind the corrupt global food economy in Stuffed and Starved. Patel takes a life-changing journey around the world as he tries to solve the mystery as to how both the starvation rate and obesity rate are at an all time high. Checking in at massive American supermarkets and wrecked Indian paddy fields, Patel goes beyond ethical consumerism and still manages to find hope in re-balancing the world food system.

<span class="span1">Beyond Bias</span><br> <!--Book id = "1018"-->
<span class="span2">by Scott Krzych</span><br><br>
Contemporary conservative documentary films. However, rather than dismiss such cases of political representation as exemplars of ideological nonsense, reactionary propaganda, and so on, Beyond Bias locates in conservative media a mode of discourse central to contemporary democratic debate in the United States. Specifically, this book identifies conservative media as a mode of hysterical discourse. As the book makes clear, hysterical political discourse occurs when debate is simulated as a means to avoid a more substantive exchange.

<span class="span1">Payback </span><br> <!--Book id = "1020"-->
<span class="span2">by Margaret Atwood</span><br><br>   
I'm convinced that anything written by Margaret Atwood is worth reading, so I was shocked when I found something by her that I had never heard about. Payback is her nonfiction novel on debt, but she doesn't steer into financial planning or the tricky issues surrounding the topic. Instead, she focuses on the big metaphor debt has played in life and how it informs our thinking, decisions, and the paths we take. As student loans and debt rises to an ultimate high, this is one fascinating subject worth diving into.

<span class="span1">The Geo-Doc</span><br> <!--Book id = "1021"-->
<span class="span2">by Terry Mark</span><br><br>
This book introduces a new form of documentary film:<br>
the Geo-Doc, designed to maximize the influential power of the documentary film as an agent of social change. By combining the proven methods and approaches as evidenced through historical, theoretical, digital, and ecocritical investigations with the unique affordances of Geographic Information System technology, a dynamic new documentary form emerges, one tested in the field with the United Nations. This book begins with an overview of the history of the documentary film with attention given to how it evolved as an instrument of social change. It examines theories surrounding mobilizing the documentary film as a communication tool between filmmakers and policymakers. Ecocinema and its semiotic storytelling techniques are also explored for their unique approaches in audience engagement. The proven methods identified throughout the book are combined with the spatial and temporal affordances provided by GIS technology to create the Geo-Doc, a new tool for the activist documentarian.

<span class="span1">Speaking Truths with Film</span><br> <!--Book id = "1022"-->
<span class="span2">by Bill Nichols</span><br><br>
Pioneering film scholar Bill Nichols investigates the ways documentaries strive for accuracy and truthfulness and simultaneously fabricate a form that shapes reality. Such films may rely on reenactment to re-create the past, storytelling to provide satisfying narratives, and rhetorical figures such as metaphor or devices such as irony to make a point. Documentaries are truly a fiction unlike any other. With clarity and passion, Nichols offers incisive commentaries on the basic questions of documentary’s distinct relationship to the reality it represents, as well as close readings of provocative documentaries from this form's earliest days to its most recent incarnations. These essays offer a definitive account of what makes documentary film such a vital part of our cultural landscape.

<span class="span1">Black Holes:The Reith Lectures</span><br> <!--Book id = "1023"-->
<span class="span2">by Stephen Hawking</span><br><br>
It is said that fact is sometimes stranger than fiction, and nowhere is that more true than in the case of black holes. Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science fiction writers. In 2016 Professor Stephen Hawking delivered the BBC Reith Lectures on a subject that has fascinated him for decades - black holes. In these flagship lectures the legendary physicist argues that if we could only understand black holes and how they challenge the very nature of space and time, we could unlock the secrets of the universe.
